# Welcome to my Ngram



## Task
 
Based on the task requirements, your task is to implement a program called my_ngram that counts the number of occurrences per character in one or multiple input strings. The program should display each character and the number of times it appears, with the output sorted in alphanumeric order. Additionally, you need to create a Makefile and follow certain rules for compilation.
    ## Description

The task requires you to implement a program called my_ngram that counts the number of occurrences per character in one or multiple input strings. The program should take the input strings as arguments and display each character along with the number of times it appears. The output should be sorted in alphanumeric order.

An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. In this case, the items are characters. The program should process the input strings and count the occurrences of each character. It should then display the characters and their corresponding counts.





 # Installation

 " gcc -o my_ngram my_ngram.c "

 
  ### The Core Team



The my_ngram function takes the command-line arguments (excluding the program name) and processes each text by calling count_occurrences for each one. It then prints the characters and their counts by iterating over the counts array.
